# devcontainer-defs
Repository for containing centralized devcontainer defintions which can be added as submodule

To use it in your own project, either add as a submodule in your project's root

```bash
:/path/to/your/project/root$ git submodule add https://github.com/EffectiveRange/devcontainer-defs .devcontainer
```

If you want to add customization to your needs into the devcontainer.json, and also version control them, you can simply fork the https://github.com/EffectiveRange/devcontainer-defs repo, and create your own commits, then add your fork as a submodule.
